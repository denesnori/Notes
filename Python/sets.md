#### Tuples
- immutable!!! -> can't add remove or assign values
- tuples are hashable
- keys in dicitionaries

Swap 2 numbers:
```
a, b = b, a
```
- create an empty tuple: ```()```
- singletopn tupple ```a,``` or ```(a,)```
- comma separated : ```a, b, c``` or ```(a,  b, c)```
- ```tuple()``` or ```tuple(iterable)``` eg. ```tuple([0,1,2])``` -> ```(0,1,2)```
