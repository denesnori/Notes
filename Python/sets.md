## Sets in Python

Reference
- [sets](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/set)


#### Tuples
- immutable!!! -> can't add remove or assign values
- tuples are hashable
- keys in dicitionaries

Swap 2 numbers:
```
a, b = b, a
```
- create an empty tuple: ```()```
- singletopn tupple ```a,``` or ```(a,)```
- comma separated : ```a, b, c``` or ```(a,  b, c)```
- ```tuple()``` or ```tuple(iterable)``` eg. ```tuple([0,1,2])``` -> ```(0,1,2)```

#### Hash
- ```hash()``` is part of the ```__builtins__``` module -> no need to import it
- return the hash value of an object, if it is defined
- has values are integers
- common usecase: make lookups quick in dicitionaries
