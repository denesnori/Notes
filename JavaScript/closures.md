### Closure

*When a function has access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has returned.*

*a stateful function*
- a closure gives access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
- in JS they are the primary mechanism for data privacy
- create a function inside another function and expose the function -> return it or pass it to another function

- commonly used in JS for: object data privacy, in event handlers and callback function, currying, and other functional programming patterns.
