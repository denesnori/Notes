### When prototypal inheritance is the right choice:
- when you need to create objects from multiple resources
- when modules and functional programming are not the right choice (TODO lookup examples)

Different types of prototypal inheritance:
- prototype delegation (eg.: prototype chains)
- concatenative inheritance (e.g.: mixins, ```Object.assign()```)
- functional (function used to crate a closure for private state encapsulation)

The create  *has-a* or *can-do* do relationships as opposed to the *is-a* relationship created with the class inheritance.
