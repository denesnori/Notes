### Symbolic link/ soft link

```
ln -s source_file my_file
```

- a link that points to another file.
- unlike a hard link, a symbolic link doesn't contain the data in the target file.
- it is like a shortcut
- if you delete the source file/ or move it to the different location,the symbolic link won't function properly.
